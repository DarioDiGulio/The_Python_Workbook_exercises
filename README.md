# The Python Workbook by Ben Stephenson
A brief introduction with exercises and solutions

> I've created this repository to show one of the many ways to solve this exercises.
I've solved all the exercises in this repository using TDD and `unittest`.

## Thinks that I learned and you could learn too

### Chapter I - Introduction to Programming Exercises
#### Test code
* Use `assertEquals` to your assertions
* use `unittest.mock` to mock your dependencies
* Test standard output and input
  * `print` and `input`
  * Multiples lines

#### Source code
* Use `print` to print to the console
* Use `input` to get input from the user
* Use math operators to calculate values, such as `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
